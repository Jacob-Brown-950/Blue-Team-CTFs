# Incident Response: Malicious XML Payload Exploitation

### **Scenario**
During your shift as a tier-2 SOC analyst, you receive an escalation from a tier-1 analyst regarding a public-facing server. This server has been flagged for making outbound connections to multiple suspicious IPs. In response, you initiate the standard incident response protocol, which includes isolating the server from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration and obtaining a packet capture from the NSM utility for analysis. Your task is to analyze the PCAP and assess for signs of malicious activity.

**Elapsed Time:** `00:04:54`

### **Top IPs Identified**
| IP Address        | Location       | Description              |
|-------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 146.190.21.92     | Netherlands    | C2 Server                |
| 134.209.197.3     | Netherlands    | Victim                   |
| 128.199.52.72     | Netherlands    | Second C2 Server         |

### **Suspicious Port Traffic**
- **Port 443** (HTTP): 4,833 Packets
- **Port 61616**: Used to execute an RCE by exploiting a Java-based application

The investigation noted suspicious traffic over these ports, leading to further analysis.

## **1. Identifying the C2 Servers**
Upon reviewing the packet capture using Wireshark, connections to **`146.190.21.92:8000`** were observed. The server requested an XML file located at `/invoice.xml`, which contained malicious code. This XML file referenced a second IP address, **`128.199.52.72`**, which was initially marked as "clean" but was later identified as another Command and Control (C2) server.

The attacker used this infrastructure to distribute and execute a malicious payload.

## **2. Analysis of the Malicious XML Payload**
The payload was delivered through a malicious XML file hosted on **`146.190.21.92`**. The XML file was structured using the Spring framework and contained the bean configuration

## **3. Explanation of the Payload**

The XML configuration initializes an instance of `java.lang.ProcessBuilder`, a standard Java class used to execute system commands. The `start()` method is invoked to execute a shell command (`bash -c`), which:

1. Downloads a file named `docker` from the second C2 server at `128.199.52.72` and saves it in the `/tmp` directory.
2. Changes the file's permissions to make it executable using `chmod +x /tmp/docker`.
3. Executes the downloaded file (`./tmp/docker`).

This method is a typical attack vector to gain initial access and control over a compromised host.

## **4.Identification of the Reverse Shell Executable**

The command contained in the XML payload indicated that the attacker downloaded a file named `docker` from the path `http://128.199.52.72/docker`. The executable was stored as `/tmp/docker` on the server. This file is likely a reverse shell executable used to establish a backdoor connection with the attackerâ€™s infrastructure.

This reverse shell would enable the attacker to maintain persistent access to the compromised server and potentially exfiltrate data or perform further malicious activities.
